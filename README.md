## How to try yourself

This is very simple the **only** files you have to change is the [text.ts](https://github.com/titivince/light-novel/blob/master/src/text.ts)

Before start coding make sure you have `Typescript` installed

If you don't have it run the command `npm install -g typescript`

If you don't know try `tsc --version` if you have an error it mean you don't have it

Run the command `tsc text.ts` or `tsc text.ts -w` is use to watch and run `tsc core.ts` to generate the Javascript core
